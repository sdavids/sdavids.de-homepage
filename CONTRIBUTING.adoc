== Contributor License Agreement

*Project License:* Apache License, Version 2.0 (link:LICENSES/Apache-2.0.txt[Apache-2.0.txt] or {uri-apache-license})

* You will only submit contributions where you have authored 100% of the content.
* You will only submit contributions to which you have the necessary rights.
This means that if you are employed you have received the necessary permissions from your employer to make the contributions.
* Whatever content you contribute will be provided under both project licenses.

== Code of Conduct

All contributors are expected to follow our link:CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md[Code of Conduct].

== Developing Features and Fixing Bugs

=== IDE Configuration

See link:CODING_STYLE{outfilesuffix}[].

=== Branching Strategy

We are using the https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow[GitHub Flow], where development happens in branches, which are merged via pull requests.
Special cases, like fixing problems with the CI pipeline, are of course exempt from this guideline.

Branch names should adhere to the following pattern: `users/username/token/branch-name-by-hyphen`.

We use the following tokens:

* *feat*: A feature
* *fix*: A bug fix branch
* *chore*: A cleanup branch

Examples:

 users/gclark/feat/improve-documentation
 users/chowe/fix/issue-13
 users/gclark/chore/update-dependencies

=== Commits

As a general rule, the style and formatting of commit messages should follow the {uri-conventional-commits}[Conventional Commits] guidelines.

We use the following types:

* *feat*: A new feature
* *fix*: A bug fix
* *chore*: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies, CI configuration files and scripts
* *docs*: Documentation only changes
* *refactor*: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* *style*: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
* *test*: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
* *revert*: Reverts a previous commit

Because of the noise it generates on the issue, please do _not_ mention the issue number in the message.

Try to fit the summary within the soft 50-character limit.

Examples:

 fix: ensure UTF-8
 docs: add license
 style: format

[NOTE]
====
There is no requirement for all commits to match the branch token, i.e. a `docs: add license` commit is OK on a `users/chowe/fix/issue-13` branch.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Add `[no ci]` to the commit message when the https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/skipping-workflow-runs[CI pipeline should not run].
====

=== Pull Requests

Pull requests are used to discuss a concrete solution, not the motivation nor requirements for it.
As such there should be at least one issue a pull request relates to.
At the same time it should be focused, so it should usually not relate to more than one issue (although that can occasionally happen).
Please mention all issues in the request's body, possibly using https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/[closing keywords] like `closes`, `fixes` (for bugs only), or `resolves`.

To enforce the <<Branching Strategy>> pull requests from `main` will be closed.
