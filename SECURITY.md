# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project will always provide security fixes for the latest version, e.g. if
the latest version is v1.1.x, then we will provide security fixes for v1.1.x.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

In case you think to have found a security issue with
_sdavids.de-homepage_, please do not open a public issue.

Instead, you can report the issue to [Sebastian Davids](mailto:sdavids@gmx.de).
I will acknowledge receipt of your message in at most three days and try to
clarify further steps.
